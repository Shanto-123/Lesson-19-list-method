number_list.append(20)` adds `20` to the end of the list.
number_list.insert(1,7)` inserts `7` at index `1`, shifting the rest of the elements.
number_list.remove(2)` removes the first occurrence of the value `2` from the list.
print(1 in number_list)` checks if `1` is present in the list and prints `True` if it is.
number_list.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list, which is `20` in this case.
